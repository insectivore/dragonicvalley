I am a 17 year old high school junior who is trying to better my limited knowledge of programming & webdevelopment by making my own website.

It is far from finished. I think it will eventually become a personal blog, a gallery for my drawings, and have some minigames and other coding projects I'm working on.

It is themed after dragons because I like them.
