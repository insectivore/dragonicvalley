				<p class="postcontent">The process of accepting the hard truth that neither my family nor my closest friends genuinely give a shit about any of my projects or creative efforts has been a painful one. As a person who, in childhood, was constantly showered with praise and encouragement by the adults around me for my mediocre artistic ventures, it's a shocking and hollow feeling to realize that neither your parents nor your best friend genuinely care about the things you put time into creating - like this website, for example.<br>However, I'm trying to look on the bright side of things. Given that I know for a <i>fact</i> that no friends or family are actually interested enough in my personal website to ever just go and visit it themselves, this gives me total freedom when it comes to what I can post about on my blog - I don't have to sanitize anything, that's exciting. At the end of the day, I think that's what this website is really all about anyways - giving myself a space where I can express myself completely, without any restrictions or fear of judgement (at least, from the people in my life that I value. I do not care what strangers on the internet who come across my website have to say about it, because they don't know me.)</p>
