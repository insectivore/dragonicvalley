				<p class="postcontent">My method for memorizing country names for my map tests is absolutely unbeatable. For a visual learner such as I, this method involves thinking of a shape or object that the country of question closely resembles, then somehow connecting that back to its name. For example, I know that Lebanon is the little teardrop-shaped middle eastern country because it kinda looks like a clitoris, and "Lebanon" sounds like "Lesbian", and lesbians like those.<br><br>More at 7, guys.</p>

				<p class="postcontent">Man, I always forget how fun writing is until I actually do it (once in a blue moon) and rediscover my love for spinning a fine old yarn.<br>The writing I'm doing now is for a school project, but I'm pretty proud of it, so I might post it on this website under my projects tab. It's about dragons so you already know it's PEAK!!!!!!!</p>

				<p class="postcontent">Now that I've actually got this thing up and running, I think a recent event in my life really deserves its own post.<br>I'd like to preface this by saying that *I love my best friend* and I hold her in high regard when it comes to her intelligence, thoughtfulness and foresight.<br>However..<br><br>She and her fucking mid ass boyfriend have SO many problems with each other, yet they can't keep themselves away from one another for more than 5 minutes at a time. They've broken up like 3 times already, and literally within the SAME DAY, like clockwork, they somehow always end up back together. I think their record time was exactly 7 hours apart or something. I actually thought they were gonna be done with one another for good by then... I guess I'm not one suited for divination practices.</p>

				<p class="postcontent">The process of accepting the hard truth that neither my family nor my closest friends genuinely give a shit about any of my projects or creative efforts has been a painful one. As a person who, in childhood, was constantly showered with praise and encouragement by the adults around me for my mediocre artistic ventures, it's a shocking and hollow feeling to realize that neither your parents nor your best friend genuinely care about the things you put time into creating - like this website, for example.<br><br>However, I'm trying to look on the bright side of things. Given that I know for a <i>fact</i> that no friends or family are actually interested enough in my personal website to ever just go and visit it themselves, this gives me total freedom when it comes to what I can post about on my blog - I don't have to sanitize anything, that's exciting. At the end of the day, I think that's what this website is really all about anyways - giving myself a space where I can express myself completely, without any restrictions or fear of judgement (at least, from the people in my life that I value. I do not care what strangers on the internet who come across my website have to say about it, because they don't know me.)</p>

				<p class="postcontent">Testing testing 123. My first post on my website's blog yayyyy!<br>My current method of making posts is VERY clunky and requires constant updates to my repository to roll them out, but once I get a MySQL database sorted out for this (and an actual fundamental understanding of PHP) this aspect of the website will be much improved. Bye for now! :)</p>
